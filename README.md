# Design Portfolio

Welcome to my design portfolio. Below I will give you instructions on how to navigate this portfolio. To get a quick sample of my ux/ui design skills, feel free to first check the sample [Mestau File](design-portfilio/sample_mestau.png), and the [Meshed File](sample_meshed_iOS.png).

Also, feel free to check my animation video of an app I helped design in 2015. It was a passion project with some friends, in hopes of building a start-up at the time. [Stilfraym iOS App](https://youtu.be/SZB_B5XY2Ao)

## UX/UI Porfolio

To browse my ux/ui portfolio without any help simply [click here](ux_ui/). For direct links, simply continue reading below. All Designs were created using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.

I will be displaying 4 different projects in my portfolio:

- [Mestau](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS): A restaurant iOS app that provided interactive menus straight to their customer's phones. In this folder I will be displaying the designs of the [Welcome Page](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/mestau_welcome.png),[Search](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/mestau_search.png), [User Profile](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/mestau_profile.png), [Navigation](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/mestau_navbar.png), [Interactive Menu](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/mestau_menu.png), and will also show the [Sample Design](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/mestau_all_72ppi.png) file again.

- Meshed: A Social iOS app that allowed users to snap their daily lives and share it within the app, in hopes of meeting like minded people in their local proximity. [Meshed Design](ux_ui/Meshed-iOS)
