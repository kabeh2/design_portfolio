# Design Portfolio

Welcome to my design portfolio. Below I will give you instructions on how to navigate this portfolio. To get a quick sample of my ux/ui design skills, feel free to first check the sample [Mestau File](sample_mestau_iOS.png), and the [Meshed File](sample_meshed_iOS.png).

Also, feel free to check my animation video of an app I helped design in 2015. It was a passion project with some friends, in hopes of building a start-up at the time: https://youtu.be/SZB_B5XY2Ao

## UX/UI Porfolio

To browse my ux/ui portfolio without any help simply [click here](ux_ui/). For direct links, simply continue reading below. All Designs were created using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.

I will be displaying 4 different projects in my portfolio:

- [Meshed](ux_ui/Meshed-iOS) - 2016: A Social iOS app that allowed users to snap their daily lives and share it to their local map, in hopes of connecting with others in their local proximity with similar interests. In this folder I will be displaying the designs of the [Edit Profile](ux_ui/Meshed-iOS/meshed_edit_profile.png), [Filter](ux_ui/Meshed-iOS/meshed_filter.png), [Navigation](ux_ui/Meshed-iOS/meshed_nav.png), [Nearby Users](ux_ui/Meshed-iOS/meshed_nearby_users.png), [User Profile](ux_ui/Meshed-iOS/meshed_profile.png), [Share Content](ux_ui/Meshed-iOS/meshed_share.png) and will also show the [Sample Design](ux_ui/Meshed-iOS/sample_meshed_iOS.png) file again.

- [Mestau](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS) - 2017: A restaurant iOS app that provided interactive menus straight to their customer's phones. In this folder I will be displaying the designs of the [Welcome Page](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/mestau_welcome.png), [Search](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/mestau_search.png), [User Profile](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/mestau_profile.png), [Navigation](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/mestau_navbar.png), [Interactive Menu](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/mestau_menu.png), and will also show the [Sample Design](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/sample_mestau_iOS.png) file again.

* [SellStrap](ux_ui/SellStrap-Web-App) - 2018: A web app that helps connect businesses to motivated Sales professionals and affiliates willing to work on a commission basis. This project taught me a lot about accessibility and responsive design as there were many user experience issues related to responsive design. This was designed as a web-first approach. In this folder I will be displaying the desings of the Future Updated [Home Page](ux_ui/SellStrap-Web-App/sellstrap_home_update.png), [Dashboard](ux_ui/SellStrap-Web-App/sellstrap_dashboard.png), [Mobile Dashboard](ux_ui/SellStrap-Web-App/sellstrap_mobile_dashboard.png), and the [Sample Mobile Designs](ux_ui/SellStrap-Web-App/sample_sellstrap_mobile.png).

- [Stilfraym](ux_ui/Stilfraym-iOS) - 2015: This project with friends was a fashion marketplace dedicated to helping designers better connect to their customer base by providing engaging tools to interact, like a voting system. It also allowed consumers to directly purchase from this app. The notion of the app was "Social Shopping", which is what is now predominant in social media ie. Instagram. In this folder I will be displaying the designs of the [Convo Page](ux_ui/Stilfraym-iOS/stilfraym_convo.png), [Explore](ux_ui/Stilfraym-iOS/stilfraym_explore.png), [Home](ux_ui/Stilfraym-iOS/stilfraym_home.png), [User Profile](ux_ui/Stilfraym-iOS/stilfraym_profile.png), [Capture Page to Sell Items](ux_ui/Stilfraym-iOS/stilfraym_sell.png), and [Shop](ux_ui/Stilfraym-iOS/stilfraym_shop.png). Some of these files are actual screenshots from the Welcome Screens of the iOS app which show partial designs of those sections. If you want a better idea on how the app functioned, please checkout the animation: https://youtu.be/SZB_B5XY2Ao.

## Other Design Examples

In the [Other Design Examples](other_design_examples/) folder I give examples of some of the graphic design work I've also done for many companies. Please allow some time for these files to load as they are around 5mb pdfs.

- [Infographic Example](other_design_examples/infographic_examples/infograph_example.pdf): This infograph was used to market to potential new home buyers and helped their company not only gain more buyers, but also land big strategic partnerships with banks and more.

- [Infographic Pitch Deck](other_design_examples/infographic_examples/old_pitch_deck_infographic/pitch_deck_mestau.pdf): This pitch deck was designed as an infograph to make the content as easy to read as possible while being visually stimulating. This pitch deck allowed the client to attract many interested Angel Investors at the time.

- [Branding Examples](other_design_examples/branding_examples/Branding_Portfolio.pdf): This file gives a sample of some of the many clients that trusted me to create their branding. From logos and business cards, to document templates and print/digital marketing materials, I was always able to go over the client's scope and produce quality work within their timelines.
