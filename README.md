# Design Portfolio

Welcome to my design portfolio. Below I will give you instructions on how to navigate this portfolio. To get a quick sample of my ux/ui design skills, feel free to first check the sample [Mestau File](sample_mestau_iOS.png), and the [Meshed File](sample_meshed_iOS.png).

Also, feel free to check my animation video of an app I helped design in 2015. It was a passion project with some friends, in hopes of building a start-up at the time. [Stilfraym iOS App](https://youtu.be/SZB_B5XY2Ao)

## UX/UI Porfolio

To browse my ux/ui portfolio without any help simply [click here](ux_ui/). For direct links, simply continue reading below. All Designs were created using Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.

I will be displaying 4 different projects in my portfolio:

- [Mestau](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS) - 2017: A restaurant iOS app that provided interactive menus straight to their customer's phones. In this folder I will be displaying the designs of the [Welcome Page](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/mestau_welcome.png), [Search](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/mestau_search.png), [User Profile](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/mestau_profile.png), [Navigation](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/mestau_navbar.png), [Interactive Menu](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/mestau_menu.png), and will also show the [Sample Design](ux_ui/Mestau-iOS/mestau_all_72ppi.png) file again.

- [Meshed](ux_ui/Meshed-iOS) - 2016: A Social iOS app that allowed users to snap their daily lives and share it to their local map, in hopes of connecting with others in their local proximity with similar interests.

In this folder I will be displaying the designs of the [Edit Profile](ux_ui/Meshed-iOS/meshed_edit_profile.png), [Filter](ux_ui/Meshed-iOS/meshed_filter.png), [Navigation](ux_ui/Meshed-iOS/meshed_nav.png), [Nearby Users](ux_ui/Meshed-iOS/meshed_nearby_users.png), [User Profile](ux_ui/Meshed-iOS/meshed_profile.png), [Share Content](ux_ui/Meshed-iOS/meshed_share.png) and will also show the [Sample Design](ux_ui/Meshed-iOS/sample_meshed_iOS.png) file again.

- [SellStrap](ux_ui/SellStrap-Web-App) - 2018: A web app that helps connect businesses to motivated Sales professionals and affiliates willing to work on a commission basis. This project taught me a lot about accessibility and responsive design as there were many user experience issues related to responsive design. This was designed as a web-first approach.

In this folder I will be displaying the desings of the Future Updated [Home Page]((ux_ui/SellStrap-Web-App/sellstrap_home_update.png), [Dashboard](ux_ui/SellStrap-Web-App/sellstrap_dashboard.png), [Mobile Dashboard](ux_ui/SellStrap-Web-App/sellstrap_mobile_dashboard.png), and the [Sample Mobile Designs](ux_ui/SellStrap-Web-App/sample_sellstrap_mobile.png).
